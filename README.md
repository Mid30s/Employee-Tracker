## Description

This project involves building a command-line interface application that allows users to manage employee data within a company. The main objective of the project is to provide a user-friendly interface that enables users to view, add, update and delete employee data, roles, and departments.

One of the problems encountered in this project was handling complex SQL queries that involved multiple table joins. In order to retrieve data that involved multiple tables, complex join statements had to be written, and errors could easily occur if these queries were not correctly written. Another challenge was designing a user-friendly interface that was easy to use for non-technical users. The use of the inquirer.js library was instrumental in providing an intuitive interface that enabled users to easily navigate and input data.

The project solved the problem of managing employee data within a company. With this application, users can easily view employee data such as their roles, salaries, and managers, and also add, update, and delete employee data.During the course of building this project, I learned several valuable skills. First, I became more proficient in using SQL and complex join statements. I also learned how to use the inquirer.js library to create user-friendly command-line interfaces. Additionally, I learned how to use the mysql2 library to connect to a MySQL database from a Node.js application.

Overall, this project provided an opportunity to work on a real-world application that involved building a user-friendly interface to manage employee data. The experience gained from this project can be applied to other projects that involve building command-line interfaces and working with databases.
